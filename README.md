# My First Blazor WebAssembly Project

This is my first Blazor WASM project, which has been in progress since February 2024.
Initially, I started with simple implementations such as a report grid, login functionality, and the use of Radzen components.
Moving forward, I plan to delve into more advanced features by incorporating JavaScript to explore various libraries similar to React.
This will allow me to enhance the quality of the project or even embark on new projects.
Please note that due to personal reasons, the database may not be available at all times.
Your understanding in this matter is greatly appreciated.

However, I promise that you can expect to see better quality projects with each visit, so stay tuned!
